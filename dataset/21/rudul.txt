Legal Issues/Questions Presented:

1. Whether petitioner's continued detention for over 14 years after acquittal violated his fundamental right to life and personal liberty under Article 21?

2. Whether Supreme Court can award compensation for deprivation of fundamental rights in a habeas corpus petition under Article 32?

Applicable Legal Provisions:

- Article 21 of the Constitution of India 
- Article 32 of the Constitution of India

Holding: 

1. Continued illegal detention of petitioner for over 14 years after acquittal is wholly unjustified and violates Article 21 right to life and personal liberty.

2. Under Article 32, the Supreme Court can award compensation for deprivation of fundamental rights in addition to issuing writs for their enforcement. 

3. The right to move the Supreme Court under Article 32 itself is a guaranteed fundamental right.

4. Monetary compensation is necessary to enforce Article 21 protection against illegal detention, and prevent systemic violation of rights.

Legal Reasoning/Rationale: 

- Article 21 cannot be satisfied by merely passing orders of release from illegal detention.

- The right to compensation is necessary to give practical content and meaning to the right to life and liberty under Article 21. 

- Compensation serves as a deterrent against violation of Article 21 by State authorities.

- Article 32 provides an expansive remedy for enforcement of fundamental rights, including compensatory relief.

- The Court rejected the objection regarding alternative remedy through a civil suit, since the right to compensation is undisputed based on illegal detention.

Rule of Law/Legal Principle Established:

- Monetary compensation can be awarded for established violation of Article 21 right to life and liberty in a habeas corpus petition filed under Article 32 seeking enforcement of fundamental rights.

Concurring and Dissenting Opinions:

None. Unanimous decision by 3-judge bench.

Implications and Significance:

- Expanded understanding of rights under Article 21, to require not just release from illegal detention but also compensation for deprivation. 

- Strengthened role of Supreme Court in enforcing fundamental rights under Article 32, through compensatory relief.

- Deterrent effect against systemic violation of fundamental rights by State authorities.

Comments/Analysis:

The decision reflects an evolving expansive approach of the Supreme Court towards reading fundamental guarantees like Article 21 to make rights effective and meaningful in practice. It marks a high point in the development of public interest litigation in India.
