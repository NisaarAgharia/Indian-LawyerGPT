Applicable Legal Provisions:

- Article 21 - Right to Life and Personal Liberty

- Article 32 - Right to approach Supreme Court for enforcement of fundamental rights

Holding(s):

1. Right to privacy is a fundamental right implicit in right to life under Article 21. It includes right to protect details of private life. 

2. Unauthorised publication of private life violates right to privacy. Remedy is civil action for damages. 

3. No prior restraint can be imposed on such publication. 

4. For public officials, no remedy for privacy violation for acts related to official duties. 

5. Government cannot sue for defamation.

Legal Reasoning/Rationale: 

- Privacy originates from tort law's recognition of right to sue for damages for privacy violations. It has attained constitutional status under Article 21.

- Earlier cases like Kharak Singh and Gobind have recognised this right under Article 21. US Supreme Court cases like Griswold v Connecticut and Roe v Wade have discussed this right in detail. 

- Right to privacy is subject to certain exceptions like public records, acts of public officials related to duties etc. This balances privacy with public interest in criticism of government. 

- Unauthorised publication of private life hurts individual dignity. But remedy is ex-post through damages, not prior restraint which affects free speech. 

- For public officials, privacy must make way for public scrutiny of their functioning. Government cannot sue for defamation as it would deter criticism.

Rule of Law/Legal Principle Established:

- Right to privacy is a fundamental right under Article 21, subject to certain exceptions. It is enforceable against private infringement through civil action.

- No prior restraint can be imposed on publication to protect privacy or prevent defamation. 

Concurring and Dissenting Opinions: None. Unanimous decision.

Implications and Significance: 

- This judgment clearly established right to privacy as a fundamental right for the first time. It has been relied on in subsequent privacy cases.

- It set out exceptions like public records, acts of officials related to duties etc. This balancing approach preserves free press. 

- It affirmed that remedy for privacy violation is ex-post through civil action, not prior restraint. This prevents abuse of privacy claims to censor speech.

- It held government cannot sue for defamation. This gives media freedom to criticise government and prevents chilling effect on press. 

Comments/Analysis:

- This progressive decision expanded Article 21 to include right to privacy as part of personal liberty. This enhanced individual rights against media intrusion. 

- At the same time, it set reasonable limits to balance privacy with free speech. This prevented privacy from overriding media's watchdog role over government.

- The ex-post damages remedy incentivises media responsibility without censorship. Prior restraint rejected to prevent abuse by government.

- Government's inability to sue for defamation incentivises media to expose misgovernance. This advances transparency, accountability.

- The balancing approach shows sensitivity to India's conditions like limited public awareness unlike US/UK. Hence some limits on free press to protect privacy.

So in conclusion, this was a balanced judgment tailoring Western privacy principles to India's needs. It advanced individual rights while preventing censorship and chilling effects on media. The ex-post remedies approach showed judicial craftsmanship balancing competing rights.
