Legal Proposition:

- Mohini Jain, a resident of Meerut, was asked by a private medical college in Karnataka to pay Rs. 60,000 per year as capitation fees for admission to MBBS course. This was based on a State notification allowing higher fees for non-resident Indian students. 

- Mohini Jain filed a writ petition under Article 32 challenging the State notification as violating the fundamental right to education under Article 21. 

- The private medical colleges and state justified higher fees for non-resident students as reasonable classification. They argued it helped colleges meet expenses since they received no government aid. 

- Medical education bodies like IMA have unanimously condemned commercialization of medical education through capitation fees.

Case History:

- The case originated with Mohini Jain, a resident of Meerut in Uttar Pradesh, seeking admission to Sri Siddhartha Medical College in Karnataka for the 1991 MBBS course.

- The college informed her that she would have to pay Rs. 60,000 per year as tuition fees as per a State notification allowing higher fees for non-Karnataka students. 

- Mohini Jain's father expressed inability to pay the high fees, leading to her being denied admission.

- Mohini Jain filed a writ petition under Article 32 before the Supreme Court challenging the State notification allowing capitation fees as unconstitutional. 

Legal Issues/Questions Presented: 

1. Whether the right to education is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution?

2. If so, whether the imposition of capitation fees by private medical colleges violates this right? 

3. Whether capitation fees result in arbitrary and unequal treatment violating Article 14?

4. Whether the State notification allowing capitation fees is valid?

Applicable Legal Provisions:

- Article 21 - Right to life and personal liberty
- Article 14 - Right to equality before law 
- Article 38, 39, 41, 45 - Directive Principles on education
- Karnataka Educational Institutions (Prohibition of Capitation Fee) Act, 1984

Holding(s):

1. Right to education is concomitant to the fundamental rights in Part III and flows from the right to life and dignity under Article 21.

2. Capitation fee commodifies education and is wholly unconstitutional. It results in arbitrary and unequal treatment violating Article 14.

3. The State notification allowing capitation fees violates the 1984 Act prohibiting such fees. Para 1(c) and 1(d) of the notification struck down. 

Legal Reasoning/Rationale: 

- Education critical to human dignity and development of personality, which is essential aspect of right to life under Article 21.

- Several provisions read together - Preamble, Articles 21, 38, 39, 41, 45 - show that the Constitution makers intended right to education, even if not explicit. 

- Capitation reduces right to education to only those who can afford it. This is arbitrary, violative of Article 14.

- Widespread condemnation of commercialization of education by medical bodies shows capitation fees are against public policy. 

- When state allows private colleges, it effectively discharges its constitutional duty. So fees can't exceed that charged in government colleges. 

- Notification allowing fees exceeding government college fees is actuallly allowing capitation fees prohibited by the 1984 Act. Hence ultra vires.

Rule of Law/Legal Principle Established:

1. Right to education intrinsic part of right to life and dignity under Article 21 even though not explicit.

2. Capitation fees arbitrary, violative of right to education under Article 21 and right to equality under Article 14.

Concurring and Dissenting Opinions:

None. Unanimous decision.

Implications and Significance: 

- Established right to education as part of fundamental rights for the first time. 

- Led to steps to reduce capitation fees and made higher education more affordable.

- Curbing of capitation fees seen as significant social justice measure.

- Strengthened standards and merit in higher education admissions.

Comments/Analysis:

- The decision reflects the dynamic nature of rights jurisprudence and a progressive interpretation of Part III.

- Culminated in the Right to Education Act, 2009 giving practical effect to a constitutionally-grounded right.

- Yet, court stopped short of mandating low-cost or free higher education. Issue of funding disparities, lack of public spend remain to be addressed.

- Legislation banning fees above government college level sought to balance public-private partnership in education.

- Decision affirmed social justice ethos of Constitution. But key issues like quality of education, public funding remain to be addressed.

- Landmark moment in making education more inclusive and accessible. But wider reforms needed for full realization of the right.
