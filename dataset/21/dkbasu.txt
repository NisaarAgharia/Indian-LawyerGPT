Headnotes 2:

Constitutional Law - Custodial violence - Guidelines to curb - Petitioners filed PIL regarding increasing custodial violence and deaths - SC issued notices to states - States' affidavits showed no decrease in custodial crimes - SC laid down binding guidelines for police authorities to curb custodial excesses - Right to life under Art.21 includes protection against torture - States obligated to pay compensation for custodial death or violence.

Legal Proposition:

This case originated from a letter petition filed in 1986 by the Executive Chairman of the West Bengal Legal Aid Services bringing to the Court's attention some news reports about several deaths in police custody and lock-ups in the state. 

The letter urged the Supreme Court to examine the issue in depth and develop 'custody jurisprudence' to curb such violations. It also suggested formulating modalities for compensation to victims of custodial torture and deaths. 

Treating this letter as a writ petition, the Court issued notice to the State of West Bengal. The State denied allegations and argued the petition was misconceived.

However, the Court felt the issue raised was of grave importance concerning frequent complaints of custodial violence. Thus, it treated this writ petition along with another similar letter petition regarding a custodial death in Uttar Pradesh.

Notices were then issued to all State Governments asking for their response on the issue of lock-up deaths. Affidavits were filed by several states.

Case History:

This writ petition was filed directly in the Supreme Court of India under Article 32 of the Constitution, which provides remedies for enforcement of fundamental rights. 

The petitioners approached the highest constitutional court due to the seriousness and prevalence of the issue across different states. No other legal recourse had been explored prior to this direct approach.

Thus, this PIL arose directly in the Supreme Court seeking guidelines and principles to curb custodial excesses and violence by police and state authorities.

Legal Issues/Questions Presented: 

1. Whether the right to life under Article 21 includes freedom from torture and assault by state authorities during custody?

2. What measures can the Supreme Court stipulate to hold police accountable and curb custodial violence and deaths?

3. Whether state owed a duty to pay compensation for established cases of custodial violation of life and liberty? 

Applicable Legal Provisions:

1. Article 21 - Right to life and personal liberty 

2. Article 22 - Protections against arrest and detention

3. Sections 330, 331 IPC - Punishments for voluntarily causing hurt to extort confession/information 

4. Section 176 CrPC - Judicial enquiry into custodial death

Holding(s):

1. Right to life under Art. 21 includes right to live with human dignity. Any form of torture violates this right.

2. Custodial torture infringes fundamental right to life. Doctrine of sovereign immunity not applicable.

3. Compensation must be paid in cases of established custodial violation of rights.

4. Laid down 11 requirements to prevent custodial crimes - like medical examination, memo of arrest etc.

5. Directed compliance and incorporation of guidelines by states into police manuals and rules.

Legal Reasoning/Rationale: 

The Supreme Court held that Article 21 confers a fundamental right to life and personal liberty. This includes the right to live with human dignity and be free of any torture or assault, especially from state authorities.

Custodial torture and violence strike at the very core of human dignity. No rationale can justify violating the right to life of even criminal suspects when in police custody. 

Referring to the Law Commission's 113th Report, the Court reasoned that custodial crimes often go unpunished due to evidentiary issues and police's failure to register FIRs against their own personnel. Thus, accountability measures were needed.

Relying on previous cases like Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa, the Court ruled that the doctrine of sovereign immunity is inapplicable to constitutional remedies under Articles 32 and 226. Victims of custodial excesses can claim compensation from the state.

The Court held the state has a duty not only to prosecute guilty officials, but also financially compensate victims for the harm caused by such custodial breaches.

Citing foreign precedents, it observed that monetary compensation serves as an effectivedeterrent and enforcement of fundamental rights where other remedies are inadequate.

Rule of Law/Legal Principle Established:

1. Right to life and human dignity under Article 21 is inviolable, even for accused and detainees.

2. Doctrine of sovereign immunity does not extend to constitutional remedies against the state for breaches of fundamental rights. 

3. Custodial torture or death warrants payment of compensation by state on strict liability principles. 

Concurring and Dissenting Opinions: 

This was an unanimous opinion by the two judge bench. Both Justice Anand and Justice Singh concurred on laying down binding guidelines to implement the right under Article 21 and holding state governments accountable for custodial excesses committed by police force.

There were no dissenting views by either judge. Both emphasized the need for transparency, accountability and sensitization of police machinery to curb such brazen abuse of powers.

Implications and Significance:

This landmark judgment has had far-reaching impact in checking rampant custodial deaths and torture by police authorities across the country. 

The 11 guidelines laid down, which range from maintaining arrest memos to prompt medical examinations, have introduced much-needed accountability and transparency into police processes.

By holding compensation must be paid for established violations, it affirmed the state's liability for custodial breaches by its agents. This ended impunity and acted as a strong deterrent.

The decision is a milestone in holding state machinery to constitutional standards of rights protection and humane policing. It has enhanced the victim's capacity to enforce fundamental rights and seek remedies against custodial excesses.

The Court showed its willingness to fashion new remedies in public law where existing statutory mechanisms were inadequate in providing relief. 

Comments/Analysis: 

This proactive exercise of constitutional powers to frame guidelines on custodial processes helped revamp antiquated police practices. It balances public security needs with safeguarding detainees' dignity.

However, effective implementation across states remains uneven. Custodial crimes still occur due to institutional failings. But now victims have stronger legal grounds for justice.

Public opinion welcomed the intervention as it addressed the culture of impunity in police agencies. But some law enforcement officials have argued compliance burdens limited resources. 

Overall, the guidelines have positively influenced police functioning and supervision. They exemplify the Supreme Court's role in defending citizens' rights and bringing state organs under constitutional discipline.
