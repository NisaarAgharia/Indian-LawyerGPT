Headnotes 2:

Constitutional Law – Religious freedom – Women's entry into temples – Validity of traditional ban on entry of women aged 10-50 years into Sabarimala temple – Whether ban violates rights of Hindu women under Articles 25(1) and 26 – Referred to larger 7-judge bench for reconsideration.

Legal Proposition:

- In September 2018, a 5-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court delivered a 4:1 verdict allowing entry of women of all ages into the Sabarimala temple in Kerala. The majority held that the traditional ban on entry of women aged 10-50 years was discriminatory and violated Hindu women's fundamental right to worship under Article 25(1). 

- Review petitions were filed challenging the judgment. The present case is the review petition filed by supporters of the traditional ban.

- The review bench of 3 judges examined the grounds for review based on 'error apparent on the face of the record' and to see if there were sufficient grounds for reconsideration.

Case History:

- A public interest litigation was filed in 2006 challenging Rule 3(b) of the Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Rules, 1965 that banned entry of women aged 10-50 years into Sabarimala temple. 

- In 1991, the Kerala High Court had upheld the constitutionality of the ban in S. Mahendran v. The Secretary, Travancore.

- In 2006, the Supreme Court referred the issue to a Constitution bench. 

- In September 2018, a 5-judge Constitution bench struck down the ban by a 4:1 majority. It held the ban was discriminatory and violated rights of Hindu women under Article 25(1).

- Review petitions were filed challenging the judgment. The present case is one such petition.

Legal Issues/Questions Presented:

1. Whether there are sufficient grounds for review of the 2018 Sabarimala judgment? 

2. Whether the case should be reconsidered by a larger bench in view of the issues involved?

3. Whether the traditional ban violates Hindu women's right to worship under Article 25(1)?

4. Whether the temple can claim protection as a religious denomination under Article 26?

Applicable Legal Provisions:

- Article 25(1) - Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion

- Article 26 - Freedom to manage religious affairs

- Rule 3(b) of the Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Rules, 1965

Holding(s): 

The Court held that:

1. The review petitions did not point out any 'error apparent on the face of the record' warranting review of the 2018 judgment.

2. However, the case involves significant questions of law that need to be reconsidered by a larger bench of 7 or more judges. 

3. All the review petitions and writ petitions on the Sabarimala issue will remain pending until the larger bench re-examines these questions.

Legal Reasoning/Rationale:

- The review petitions argued that exclusion of women aged 10-50 is an essential religious practice of the temple, and did not amount to discrimination. 

- However, the Court found these arguments were already made earlier and did not form sufficient grounds for review. Mere re-arguments cannot justify review.

- But the Court noted the case involved significant constitutional questions on the interplay between religious freedom under Articles 25/26 and other fundamental rights. There were also issues like the meaning of constitutional morality.

- The Court referred to the apparent conflict between the Shirur Mutt (1954) and Durgah Committee (1962) cases on the role of the Court in determining essential religious practices. 

- Given the issues involved, it would be appropriate if a larger bench of 7 or more judges re-examined them, instead of the 3-judge review bench. This would ensure an authoritative determination. 

- Hence, the Court directed the larger bench re-examination while keeping the review and writ petitions pending.

Rule of Law/Legal Principle Established or Applied:

1. Review is permitted only on 'error apparent on face of record' and not for re-arguing matters.

2. Constitutional issues should be authoritatively settled by larger benches of 5 or more judges. 

3. Essential religious practices are to be determined by Courts based on materials, beliefs, and textual authorities.

Concurring and/or Dissenting Opinions:

Justice R.F. Nariman wrote a separate concurring opinion agreeing with the decision to refer the matter to a larger bench. But he provided a detailed reasoning refuting the review arguments on merits as well.

Implications and Significance: 

- Provides clarity on when review is permissible - only for errors apparent on record and not for re-arguing matters.

- Reiterates the importance of larger benches to authoritatively determine substantial constitutional questions. 

- The larger bench will have an opportunity to reconsider the issues in detail and provide an authoritative determination.

- The decision impacts women's rights and religious freedom guaranteed under the Constitution.

Comments or Analysis: 

- The reference to a larger bench was perhaps inevitable given the sharp split in the original verdict. However, the Court should have specified the time frame for the larger bench reconsideration to avoid uncertainty.

- The Court rightly refrained from staying the original judgment, hence it will continue to operate. However, the uncertainty may result in fresh litigation. 

- The Court has displayed judicial statesmanship in recognizing the need for authoritative determination of far-reaching constitutional issues. However, the larger bench should expeditiously hear the matter.

- This case will have important implications on the balance between religious freedom and fundamental rights. The larger bench decision will guide the discourse.

The case highlights the challenges in delineating the boundaries between religious practices and rights of adherents and individuals. The Court has rightly opted for detailed reconsideration of the issues involved by a larger bench. However, an expeditious decision will be important to provide clarity on this complex issue. 

Overall, the reference to a larger bench is a prudent decision to comprehensively reconsider the issues raised and provide authoritative guidance. However, it casts uncertainty over Sabarimala till the larger bench finally decides the matter.
