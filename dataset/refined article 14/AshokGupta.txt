- Between 1981-1994, respondents (SC/ST candidates) were promoted to higher posts in UP PWD under this reservation policy.

- Allahabad HC dismissed petition in 1993, upholding validity of promotion reservation.  
- Appellants appealed to Supreme Court against High Court judgment.

1. Whether reservation in promotions under Articles 16(4) and 16(4A) violates fundamental right to equality under Articles 14 and 16(1)?

- No evidence that reservation in promotions affects efficiency of administration under Article 335.
