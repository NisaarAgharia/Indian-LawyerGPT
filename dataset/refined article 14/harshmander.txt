- The petitioners filed writ petitions in 2009 and 2015 challenging the constitutional validity of the Act. 

- A single judge of Delhi High Court in Ram Lakhan v. State (2007) had observed that begging may be protected under right to free speech under Article 19(1)(a).

- The petitions were heard by a Division Bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C. Hari Shankar.

1. Whether the provisions of the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959 criminalizing begging violate the fundamental right to equality under Article 14?

2. Whether criminalizing begging violates the fundamental right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution? 

3. Whether the provisions violate the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a)?

- Article 21 of the Constitution of India (Right to Life and Liberty)

Holding(s):

1. Sections 4, 5, 6 and other provisions of Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959 criminalizing begging are unconstitutional as it violates Article 14, 19 and 21.

2. The court struck down Sections 4, 5, 6 and other related provisions criminalizing begging as manifestly arbitrary and violative of Articles 14, 19 and 21. 

3. Begging is a symptom of poverty and criminalizing it deprives the poorest sections of the right to life and dignity. 

4. The State failed to discharge its constitutional obligation to provide every citizen necessity of life. Presence of beggars evidence of State's failure.

5. Criminalizing begging targets vulnerable sections of society; does not distinguish between voluntary and forced begging.

6. Supreme Court has held right to life includes right to food, clothing, shelter, education, healthcare and livelihood. 

7. The Act is manifestly arbitrary as it criminalizes even involuntary begging due to poverty.

Legal Reasoning/Rationale: 

- The statute makes no distinction between voluntary and forced begging. This manifestly arbitrary and violates Article 14.

- Criminalizing begging targets the poorest sections of society who beg due to poverty and deprives them of their fundamental right to life and liberty under Article 21. 

- Begging is protected under right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) subject to reasonable restrictions. Complete criminalization excessive.  

- Article 21 right to life has been interpreted to include right to food, clothing, shelter, education etc. The State failed to discharge its duty under the Constitution.

- Presence of beggars is evidence of failure of the State to provide bare necessities of life to all citizens. Criminalizing them violates their dignity. 

- Forced begging can be addressed by specific legislation based on empirical examination. Complete criminalization disproportionate.

Rule of Law/Legal Principle Established:

- Complete criminalization of begging violates fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19 and 21. 

- State has a duty under Constitution to provide bare necessities of life essential for right to live with dignity. 

- Article 21 right to life includes right to food, shelter, clothing, education, livelihood etc. 

- Under the Constitution, State must ensure justice, liberty, equality and dignity to all citizens. 

Concurring and Dissenting Opinions:

None. Unanimous decision by the Division Bench.

Implications and Significance: 

- Striking down the law de-criminalizes begging and prevents arbitrary detention of the homeless and poor. 

- Expands scope of right to life under Article 21 based on previous Supreme Court decisions.

- Places greater responsibility on State to secure socio-economic rights and provide social security.

- More targeted legislation needed to address forced begging. Focus should be on rehabilitation not criminalization.

- Judgment affirms commitment to safeguarding dignity of the marginalized and upholds constitutional values of justice, equality and fraternity. 

Comments/Analysis:

- The decision is significant as it advances the constitutional transformation of Article 21 into an umbrella right encompassing various socio-economic entitlements essential for right to life and human dignity. 

- It reaffirms the State's commitment to securing social justice for vulnerable sections as mandated by the Constitution's preamble and directive principles.

- The Court adopted an expansive interpretation of right to life, favoring protection of dignity and socio-economic rights of the marginalized.

- The ruling is socially progressive but the State needs a roadmap to rehabilitate beggars and address the root causes of poverty and destitution. Merely de-criminalizing begging without providing alternatives is insufficient.

- The Court reaffirmed the transformative vision of the Constitution as a tool for empowerment of the marginalized and underprivileged sections.
