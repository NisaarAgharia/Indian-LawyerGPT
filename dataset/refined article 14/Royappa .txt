Legal Proposition:
E.P. Royappa, a senior IAS officer of Tamil Nadu cadre, was appointed as officiating Chief Secretary in November 1969. In April 1971, a new political party DMK came to power and its leader became the Chief Minister. Royappa was transferred from the post of Chief Secretary, first to the post of Deputy Chairman of State Planning Commission and then to the post of Special Officer for rationalizing sales tax laws. A junior IAS officer was appointed and confirmed as the new Chief Secretary. Royappa challenged his transfer by filing a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution, alleging that the transfer was arbitrary, discriminatory, mala fide and violated his fundamental rights under Articles 14, 16 and 311. 

Case History:
E.P. Royappa joined the IAS in the Tamil Nadu cadre in the 1950s. He was promoted to the Selection Grade in 1968. Between 1964-1969, he served in various roles in the Revenue Department. 

In November 1969, the outgoing Chief Secretary Ramakrishnan retired after completing 35 years of service. Royappa was appointed as officiating Chief Secretary. Ramakrishnan proceeded on 4 months refused leave and continued to hold lien on the post. In March 1970, Royappa recommended his own confirmation as Chief Secretary. However, no orders were passed.

In March 1971, new elections brought DMK to power with its leader becoming the new Chief Minister. In April 1971, Royappa was transferred to the newly created post of Deputy Chairman of State Planning Commission. However, Royappa proceeded on leave and did not join. In June 1972, on return from leave, Royappa was re-appointed as Deputy Chairman. Again he objected to the post's validity. 

In June 1972, Royappa was transferred and appointed as Special Officer for rationalising sales tax laws. He again did not join and proceeded on leave. A junior IAS officer Sabanayagam was appointed as Chief Secretary.

In July 1972, Royappa filed a writ petition in Supreme Court under Article 32 challenging his transfer as arbitrary, discriminatory, mala fide and violating his fundamental rights under Articles 14, 16 and 311.

Legal Issues/Questions Presented:
1. Whether the transfer of the petitioner from the post of Chief Secretary to the posts of Deputy Chairman and Special Officer violates his fundamental rights under Articles 14, 16 and 311 of the Constitution?

2. Whether the posts transferred to were inferior in status and responsibility compared to the Chief Secretary? 

3. Whether the transfer was mala fide, arbitrary and intended to victimise the petitioner?

Applicable Legal Provisions:
1. Article 14 of the Constitution of India - Right to Equality
2. Article 16 of the Constitution of India - Equality of Opportunity in Public Employment
3. Article 311 of the Constitution of India - Dismissal, Removal or Reduction in Rank of Persons Employed in Civil Capacities under the Union or a State
4. Rule 4 of IAS (Cadre) Rules, 1954 
5. Rule 9 of IAS (Pay) Rules, 1954

Holding(s): 
The Supreme Court dismissed the petition and held that:

1. The petitioner's appointment as Chief Secretary was only in an officiating capacity. He had no right to hold the post substantively.

2. The transfer did not violate any rules. The posts transferred to were not shown to be inferior in status and responsibility to the Chief Secretary. 

3. There was no adequate evidence to establish mala fides in the transfer. 

Legal Reasoning/Rationale:
- Officiating appointments do not confer a right to hold the post. The previous Chief Secretary Ramakrishnan retained a lien on the post while on refused leave. (FR 86, FR 13)

- Under Rule 4 of IAS (Cadre) Rules, State Government cannot unilaterally add or alter the cadre strength. The posts transferred to were not permanent cadre posts.

- Under Rule 9 of IAS (Pay) Rules, a cadre post can be transferred to another equivalent post. The Department upgraded the transferred posts to match the Chief Secretary's pay only to protect the petitioner's pay. 

- The court cannot examine allegations of general misrule. The burden of proving mala fides in transfer is very high. There was no contemporaneous proof showing malice or victimization.

Rule of Law/Legal Principle Established or Applied:

1. An officiating appointment does not confer substantive right to the post. The lien of the previous incumbent continues. 

2. Under service rules like IAS Cadre Rules and Pay Rules, the government can transfer officers between equivalent posts.

3. Violation of service rules itself does not violate fundamental rights under Articles 14, 16 and 311 unless discrimination or victimization is proved.

4. The burden of proving mala fide is very high in case of high constitutional functionaries. Clear proof of malice is required.

Concurring and Dissenting Opinions:

There were two concurring opinions by:

A.N. Ray, C.J. and D.G. Palekar, J. 

Y.V. Chandrachud, P.N. Bhagwati and V.R. Krishna Iyer, JJ.

Both opinions agreed on dismissing the petition but differed on certain reasons like the nature of appointment as Chief Secretary being officiating versus substantive.

Implications and Significance:

- Reinforced prior service jurisprudence on the nature of officiating appointments and lien on posts. 

- Laid down principles for examining the validity of transfer of civil servants and the high burden of proof in alleging mala fides against high functionaries.

- Emphasized service rules provisions allowing transfer between equivalent posts in public interest.

- Discussed the limited scope of judicial review in examining allegations of misrule against the political executive. 

Comments/Analysis:

This case was significant as one of the early cases defining the scope of constitutional protections for civil servants against executive excess. It elucidated the concepts of 'lien', 'officiating' appointment and the service rules governing transfer of officers. At the same time, it recognized the limitations of the Court in evaluating the decisions of the political executive. The high burden imposed to prove mala fides shielded the political class. Later cases enhanced safeguards against arbitrary executive action. However, the balance between civil service autonomy and political executive's discretion remains a contested issue even today.
